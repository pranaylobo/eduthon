The Problem:
Due to the covid-19 pandemic the current education system came to a stand-still.Now we needed to restart the activities such as
labs,quizzes,online-lectures.Hence our team came up with E-learning Portal.A Portal that bring Virtual-Labs,Test-case environment,developer friendly environment,webinars,lectures
all at one place.
Features:
# Virtual Lab :
Virtual Labs helps to have students to have practicals,submit
them without having to install any software
# Test-Case:
Teachers can use their custom test cases to verify a students work.
Test cases are very important in a competitive approach
# Lab Manual:
We give the ability to the teachers to make,edit the lab manual in a
form of a competitive programming approach
# Quiz:
MCQ Based Problem solving is one of most important in any stream.We
have taken this this practice and notched it up.
# Webinar/Lecture:
Due to the pandemic online lectures are getting momentum
but sharing the link among 100 plus students is not secure + inefficient.Hence
we have introduced a webinar system that supports google meet,zoom,telegram any video calling platform which gets directly connected
into our platform.Hence the teacher has to not send any link.On one click the
students get in
